# Dataset Information

## Disclaimer

This dataset may contain abusive or foul language, inappropriate jokes, or other offensive content. The data is collected from various online sources and is provided as-is. Users should exercise discretion when using this dataset.

## Raw Data

The raw data was gathered from multiple subreddits using the Reddit API via the `praw` library. Specifically, data was collected from the following subreddits:

- `TheOnion`
- `nottheonion`
- `bbc`
- `clevercomebacks`
- `cnn`
- `PrivateEye`
- `Clickhole`
- `worldnews`
- `TheBabylonBee`
- `politics`

Posts were extracted from different sorting categories (`top`, `hot`, `new`, and `controversial`), and the dataset was cleaned to remove duplicate entries, excessively long posts, and posts with fewer than four words.

## Data

The dataset consists of text data extracted from Reddit posts. Each entry contains:

- `text`: The title of the Reddit post.
- `label`: This field is currently empty and will be replaced with the labels by the annotator ,the labels are Sarcastic or Not-Sarcastic.

## Segments

The dataset is divided into eight CSV files (`data_1.csv` to `data_8.csv`).

- `data_1.csv` and `data_2.csv` share 192 common entries, with 48 unique entries in each.
- `data_3.csv` and `data_4.csv` share 96 common entries, with 144 unique entries in each.
- `data_5.csv` to `data_8.csv` each contain 240 unique entries.

This segmentation ensures a structured distribution of data for the 15% common data overall to to calculate annotator agreement.

## Additional Information

- Use of AI : For this stage of the project, AI/ChatGPT was used for three queries-> one to generate a template for the annotation guidelines and two for the README.md file. Given that the estimated carbon footprint per query is 4.32g COâ‚‚, the total emissions for these queries amount to approximately 12.96g .
